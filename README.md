This is the `.bash_profile` configuration that I use on my primary workstation. 

I've posted it here so that I can easily add it do different computers, remote servers for ease of use, and show people the configuration that I have. 

Here are the highlights:
- The CLI prompt will always be [current-user]@[computer-name]:[current working directory]
- I've aliased the `ls` command to `ls -GFlah` which I find gives me much more helpful information about the files/folders in the directory I'm currently looking at.
- I've created a `repos` alias which takes me directly to the folder where I store all my git repositories.
- I've aliased `python3` to `py` and `python` to `python2`, because with the default behavior I commonly forget to use the `python3` command when working with files that are supposed to be handled with the Python 3 interpreter.
- I've also added some custom color configurations so I can more easily navigate the command line.

Hope this is useful to you!
